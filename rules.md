# Rules
## Components
In addition to the components included in the base game of Catan, you will need:
- 2 decks of standard playing cards

The following components from the base game are repurposed and will be described in this manual by their new name:
|Original name|New name|
|---|---|
|Robber|First player marker|

## Setup
### Prepare the production deck
1. Add cards of the specified value (suit does not matter) from the indicated decks to create the 36 card production deck.

|Card value|Quantity from deck 1|Quantity from deck 2|Total|
|---|---|---|---|
|2|1||1|
|3|2||2|
|4|3||3|
|5|4||4|
|6|4|1|5|
|7|4|2|6|
|8|4|1|5|
|9|4||4|
|10|3||3|
|J|2||2|
|Q|1||1|

2. Shuffle the production deck

### Prepare the game board
1. Set up the game board according to the "Set-up, variable - fully random setup" in the Catan manual.

### Prepare the development cards
1. Place the 14 knight cards face up near the game board.
2. Shuffle the remaining 11 development cards (6 progress cards, 5 victory point cards) and place face down near game board.
3. Draw top 2 development cards to form devlopment scoring card market.
4. Place one of the dice next to each of the development scoring cards set to a value of 6

### Prepare the robber area
1. Place one card of each resource type (brick, grain, lumber, ore, wool) face up near the production deck.

## Initial placement
### 1. Select first player
The player who most recently visited Catan takes the first player token.
Otherwise, select the starting player randomly.

### 2. Initial placement
Standard Catan placement. 

1. Starting with the first player, and continuing in clockwise order, each player places one settlement and one road according to the placement process.
2. Starting with last player, and continuing in reverse order, each player places one settlement and one road according to the placement process.
**Note:** the second settlement does not need to be connected to the players first settlement/road.

Placement process:
1. Place one settlement on any [legal site](#legal-site) on the board
2. Place a road on any of the three edges adjacent to the settlement

### 3. Collect starting resources
Each player takes one of each resource into their hand.

## Turn structure
### Set up
1. Deal production cards face up in the production area equal to the number of players.

### Knight phase
1. Starting with the first player, each player may play one knight card.

#### Playing a knight card
1. Play a knight card from your hand face up in front of you.
2. Select one of the resources in the robber area that has not had a knight applied to it this turn.
  - Gain one of the corresponding resources to your hand
  - Flip the resource card or leave it on its current side
  - Turn the resource card to its side (tap) to indicate that it has had a knight applied to it this round
3. If you have played at least three and more knight cards than all your opponents, take the largest army bonus.
4. Keep your knights face up in front of you for the rest of the game.

### Production phase
1. Starting with the first player, each player must either:
  - Take one of the face up production cards
  - Take the top card from the deck

#### If the production card is a 7:
1. Select one of the resources in the robber area that has not had a knight applied to it this turn.
  - Gain one of the corresponding resources to your hand
  - Flip the resource card or leave it on its current side

#### If the production card is not a 7:
1. All players with buildings adjacent to a tile of the selected number gain resources of that tile type if that resource type is currently available (face up) in the robber area.
- gain 1 resource of that type per adjacent settlement
- gain 2 resources of that type per adjacent city
2. The player who selected the production card receives a bonus as per the following table:

|Card value|Bonus|
|---|---|
|2 or 12|+2 resources of any type|
|3 or 11|+1 resource of tile type & +1 resource of any type|
|4 or 10|+1 resource any type |
|5 or 9|+1 resource of tile type|
|6 or 8|no bonus|

NOTES:
- If you have buildings adjacent to mutliple tile types with the selected number, you may select any of them tiles for the tile type bonus.
- You only receive the bonus one time, regardless of how many adjacent tiles, cities, or settlements you have
- You must have a building adjacent to a tile of the selected number in order to receive the bonus
- You receive the bonus even if the resource is unavailible for production (face down)

### Trading phase
All players may trade any of their resource cards (not knight or development cards) with each other.

### Building phase
Starting with the first player and continuing in clockwise order, all players are given the opportunity to build or upgrade structures.
You may purchase as many of these items as you can afford in whatever order.

#### Roads
Cost: 1 brick + 1 lumber + toll

Place one of your roads along one of the edges of a hex. 
The road must be adjacent to one of your exisiting settlements/cities or roads.
If a road already exists on the segment, you must pay one additional resource of your choosing to each player with a road on that segement as toll.

If you have a contiguous road of at least 5 segments and more than any other opponent, take the longest road bonus.

#### Settlements
Cost: 1 brick + 1 grain + 1 lumber + 1 wool
Build according to standard Catan rules.

#### Cities
Cost: 2 grain + 3 ore
Upgrade a settlement to a city according to standard Catan rules.

#### Knights
Cost: 1 grain + 1 ore + 1 wool

Take one of the knights and add it to your hand. 

#### Development scoring cards
Purchase a development scoring card by paying the following cost.
These cards may be kept secret.

|Dice value|Cost|
|---|---|
|6 or none|1 of each type + 1 additional|
|5|5 unique resources|
|4|4 unique resources|
|3|3 unique resources|
|2|2 unique resources|
|1|1 resource|

Replace the slot in the market with the top card of the deck.
Do not place a die on the new card.

### Clean up
1. Check [game end](#game-end)
2. All players discard resources down to hand limit of 7.
3. Return any tapped robber cards to their initial orientation (but do not flip).
4. Discard all selected and remaining production cards.
  - If all 6 robber cards are in the discard pile, shuffle the discard cards with the production card deck.
5. Update development scoring market
  - if there is not currently dice on a card, add one with value 6
  - otherwise, decrease value on dice by 1
  - if value is 1, do nothing

## Game end
The game ends at the end of a round if:
- The development scoring pile is empty
- A player has built all 4 cities (or some other building based game end)

## Scoring
All players score:
- 1 point per settlement
- 2 points per city
- 1 per knight played

The current holders of the largest army/longest road score:
- 2 points for largest army
- 2 points for longest road

The development scoring cards score:
|Card name|Score|
|---|---|
|Road building|1 point for every 2 roads, rounded down|
|Monopoly|2 points for each city|
|Year O Plenty|1 point for each knight|
|Chapel|+1 for each building adjacent to grain|
|Great hall|+1 for each building adjacent to brick|
|Library|+1 for each building adjacent to lumber|
|Market|+1 for each building adjacent to wool|
|University|+1 for each building adjacent to ore|

The player with the highest score wins.

## Important differences from standard Catan
- the development cards do not provide their specified value
- the resources provided at setup are one of each, not dependent on what cities you touch

## Glossary
### Legal site
Any vertice where the three neighboring vertices are unoccupied.

## Areas to balance
- Cost of each item
- The production bonuses are likely unbalanced.
- Make sure the knight/robber workflow works
- Figure out how the trading powers come into play
- Scoring needs to be balanced
- Game end conditions
- Apply hand limit at different time
- Could move the cost reduction so it always happens on the next turn (immediately place a 6 die when you flip a card)
- decide how to count the scoring cards when it borders multiple (is a city that is adjacent to 3 ore tiles worth 1 or 3?)

## Ideas
- other scoring types
  - number of buildings
  - number of cities
  - types of resources
  - +1 per knight
